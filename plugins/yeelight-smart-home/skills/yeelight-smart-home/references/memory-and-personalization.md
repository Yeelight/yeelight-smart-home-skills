# Memory And Personalization

Use this reference for local memory, preferences, and personalization.

## Intent Routing

- Use `memory.remember` only for an explicit preference the user wants saved.
- Use `memory.list` when the user asks what is remembered.
- Use `memory.pause` or `memory.resume` for learning controls.
- Use `memory.forget` for export-and-delete requests in the current profile and house scope.
- For `memory.remember`, pass semantic fields `scopeType`, `scopeRef`, `preferenceType`, `preferenceValue`, optional `kind`, and `evidence`; do not wrap the preference inside a nested free-form object.

## Memory Classes

- Explicit preferences are direct user instructions such as preferred ambience, disliked color modes, aliases, room purposes, or "do not recommend" choices.
- Implicit candidates are repeated behavior signals inferred by Runtime. Treat them as low-confidence candidates unless Runtime promotes or returns them.
- Single behavior observations, one correction, or one undo are candidates only; never describe them as long-term memory by themselves.
- Current-turn instructions override saved preferences. Explicit dislikes override explicit likes, accepted personalization, implicit candidates, and generic recipes.

## Safety And Privacy

- Memory is scoped by local profile and house; never merge or reveal another house's preferences.
- Keep profile and house isolation strict. Do not combine memories across accounts, homes, hosts, or families.
- Never save secrets, account data, raw identifiers, auth material, cookies, full chat logs, or token-like values.
- First saved memory requires Runtime consent handling. Do not claim consent, consent version, retention, export, or deletion state was recorded unless Runtime confirms it.
- Default retention: explicit preferences stay until the user forgets or deletes them; implicit candidates last about 30 days; recommendation evidence and interaction evidence last about 90 days. Do not claim event-history retention is implemented unless Runtime returns event-history data.
- Export results are local Runtime snapshots for the current scope. Do not promise encrypted import/export or cross-device restore unless Runtime explicitly returns that support.

## Execution Rules

- `memory.remember` is a persistent local change. Follow Runtime's pending-plan confirmation and commit only the returned plan id.
- `memory.forget` exports the current scope snapshot and then deletes local consent, preferences, and recommendations for that scope when Runtime confirms it.
- `memory.pause` and `memory.resume` affect local learning only; they do not change cloud devices or home configuration.
- Persistent home changes suggested by memory still require Runtime planning and confirmation.
- Implicit candidates must not directly create room, group, scene, automation, device, gateway, or favorite configuration.
- Low-risk personalization may adjust wording or suggested defaults only when Runtime returns enough evidence; still explain that it is a preference-based suggestion, not an applied change.
- Recommendation feedback such as reject, cooldown, or permanent suppression must be respected.
